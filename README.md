AffdexMe OSC for Wekinator
===

This app uses the [Affectiva SDK](http://developer.affectiva.com) to output OSC data, suitable for [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) machine learning. 

This is a minimally working program.

It is forked from the [Affectiva OSX Demo app](https://github.com/Affectiva/affdexme-osx) and uses [CocoaOSC](https://github.com/danieldickison/CocoaOSC) for OSC communication.
